Why? Because CMMC success hinges as much on how you frame the work as on the work itself. This session flips the script to focus on the missteps service providers most often make when guiding organizations seeking certification (OSCs).\n\n- **Scoping that sticks:** Draw a defendable CUI boundary before deploying tools, so your services—and your invoices—align with what assessors actually review.\n- **Practice vs. objective gap:** Translate the 110 practices into 320 assessment objectives, and map ticket data, dashboards, and change records to each one.\n- **Inheritance without illusion:** Understand how assessors verify shared-responsibility claims, and the artifacts you must deliver to prove your controls protect the OSC.\n- **Document-first delivery:** Adopt a \"write, do, prove\" cadence—policies, diagrams, and POA&Ms drafted alongside engineering tasks—to keep the client's SSP and your statement of work in sync.\n- **Timing & training traps:** Avoid last-minute rollouts and ad-hoc user briefings that undermine otherwise solid implementations.\n- **Provider readiness roadmap:** Prioritized actions and communication tactics that convert technical excellence into certifiable compliance for every engagement.\n\nIf you're an MSP, MSSP, RPO, or any external team supporting the defense industrial base, this session will sharpen your strategy, tighten your evidence trail, and position both you and your clients for first-pass success.\n\nRead More →\n\n1:20 PM - 4:30 PM\n\n![Michael Greenman](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/M.-Greeman-hs.png)\n\n![Charlie Tupitza • Facilitator](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charlie-Tupitza-1.png)\n\n![James Goepel • Facilitator](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jim-Goepel-hs.png)\n\nDeltek's Architecture & Construction (3-hour Breakout)\n\nMichael Greenman\n\nSr. Manager, Cloud Solutions • Deltek\n\nCharlie Tupitza • Facilitator\n\nDirector of Community Development • Global Resilience Federation\n\nJames Goepel • Facilitator\n\nCEO and General Counsel • Fathom Cyber LLC\n\n📍 Potomac 1\n\nJoin us for a round-robin style interactive discussion.\n**Details:**\n\n1.

This session equips service providers and OSCs with a vendor-agnostic checklist for separating genuine enablers from costly distractions.\n\n- **Define the job before the tool:** Pin every feature request to a specific control objective—evidence management, continuous monitoring, risk analytics—before you read a sales deck.\n- **Proof over promises:** Require artifacts, log samples, and role mappings that demonstrate how the product satisfies assessment objectives, not just practice buzzwords.\n- **Integration reality—how much and where?** Decide whether to pipe compliance data into everyday dashboards and client reports or keep it siloed and simply point auditors to the source; deep APIs boost real-time decision-making but add failure points, upkeep, and scope creep.\n- **Operational reuse of compliance intel:** Select platforms that let management repurpose collected evidence—policies, logs, metrics—into board dashboards, capacity planning, and service-provider health reports, turning audit data into continuous business insight.\n- **Watch for scope inflation:** Spot features that silently widen the compliance boundary or duplicate tools you already own.\n- **Usability where it counts:** Ensure admins, auditors, and executives can each pull what they need—no vendor hand-holding required.\n- **Total cost of ownership:** Look past license fees to setup labor, scripting, annual reassessment updates, and hidden \"premium\" modules.\n- **Snake-oil red flags:** Flag claims that clash with DFARS or Title 48 (\"self-certification guaranteed,\" \"no documentation necessary\")—and know when to walk away.\n\nLeave with a practical evaluation matrix and the confidence to ask tough questions—so every tool you adopt accelerates compliance and generates management insight instead of becoming your next expensive trap.\n\nRead More →\n\n3:10 PM - 3:40 PM\n\n🍴\n\n\nPM Break\n\n📍 Potomac A/B (Expo Hall)\n\n3:40 PM - 4:30 PM\n\n![Jarrod Peterson](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Jarrod-Peterson-bio-headshot1.png)\n\n![James Goepel](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jim-Goepel-hs.png)\n\n![Amy Williams](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Amy-Williams-bio-headshot.png)\n\n![Brett Cox](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Brett-Cox-hs.png)\n\nSupply Chain Demands under CMMC - The Two-Way Pain of Flowdown\n\nJarrod Peterson\n\nSr. Manager, Enterprise Risk • General Dynamics Mission Systems\n\nJames Goepel\n\nCEO and General Counsel • Fathom Cyber LLC\n\nAmy Williams\n\nVP Compliance and Education • FutureFeed\n\nBrett Cox\n\nPrincipal DFARS CMMC Program Management Office • Boeing\n\n📍 Potomac C\n\nWith Title 48 expected to be finalized by October 2025, keeping suppliers and subcontractors aligned with CMMC and DFARS 252.204-7020/7021 will be a contractual must for every prime contractor.

With Title 48, new DFARS clauses, and a forthcoming FAR CUI rule set to make third-party certification the norm by October 2025, legal exposure for both primes and service providers is poised to spike.\n\nThis legal-centric briefing—delivered by government-contract attorneys, former DOJ cyber-fraud prosecutors, and veteran C3PAO assessors—breaks down the latest enforcement data, average settlement figures, and hard-won lessons every contractor and managed service provider needs before their next audit.\n\n- **Fresh enforcement landscape:** Title 48's final text, mandatory C3PAO certification for nearly all Level 2 contracts, and stepped-up DIBCAC spot checks redefine \"material misrepresentation\" for primes and their MSPs, RPOs, and SaaS vendors.\n- **Whistleblower war stories:** Qui tam cases triggered by a breach report, a fudged SPRS score, or an ignored POA&M—complete with multimillion-dollar settlements and co-defendant service providers.\n- **Fragile self-attestation:** Level 1—and the few Level 2 carve-outs—still rely on self-scores, but a whistleblower claim can put every assertion under a microscope, leaving no time to close gaps before DOJ or prime scrutiny hits.\n- **Privilege architecture:** Structuring attorney-client/Kovel engagements so readiness gaps are remediated under legal cover—privilege cannot be bolted on after an RPO is already engaged.\n- **Contract flow-down liabilities:** What primes now demand in affidavits and supplier attestations, and how a provider's misstep can drag an entire program into litigation.\n- **Insurance & M&A ripple effects:** How carriers, investors, and acquirers are tightening cyber due-diligence checklists and exclusions as FCA risk rises.\n\nRead More →\n\n4:30 PM - 5:30 PM\n\n![Break Logo](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IsI-2.png)\n\nHappy Hour\n\n📍 Potomac A/B (Expo Hall)\n\n📅 Day 2 Schedule\n\n## Friday, October 17\n\nContinuing with expert sessions, practitioner insights, and hands-on learning\n\n\n8:00 AM - 9:00 AM\n\n![Break Logo](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CyberSheath_reversed-scaled.png)\n\nBreakfast\n\n📍 Potomac A/B (Expo Hall)\n\n9:00 AM - 9:50 AM\n\n![James Harper](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/J.-Harper.png)\n\n![Beth Leonard](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/B.-Leonard.png)\n\n![Thomas Graham](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/T.-Graham.png)\n\n![Matt Bruggeman](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/M.-Bruggman.png)\n\n![Jason Sproesser](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/J.-Sproesser.png)\n\nYou Can't Do That with Your ESP\n\nJames Harper\n\nCEO • Quatronics\n\nBeth Leonard\n\nCOO • R3 LLC\n\nThomas Graham\n\nC3PAO Advisory Council • The Cyber AB\n\nMatt Bruggeman\n\nDirector of GTM Federal • A-LIGN\n\nJason Sproesser\n\nModerator • Summit 7\n\n📍 Potomac C\n\n_Untangling the Truth Behind External Service Provider Promises_\n\nExternal Service Providers (ESPs) can accelerate a CMMC program, but they don't erase your accountability—or an assessor's scrutiny. In this frank panel, a veteran CMMC assessor, an ESP executive, a contracts attorney, and a defense-industry OSC unpack the promises, limits, and documentation every organization must nail down before handing off critical controls.\n**What the panel will cover:**\n\n- **Inheritance clarified:** Which controls can legitimately pass to CSPs, MSPs, MSSPs, and specialized compliance providers—and which always stay with the OSC.\n- **Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM):** Why every engagement needs a provider-signed CRM, the minimum details it must contain, and how assessors use it to assign evidence ownership.\n- **Contract language that stands up:** Clauses for SLAs, log retention, and right-to-audit that survive legal review and satisfy auditors.\n- **Red-flag promises to avoid:** Misleading claims such as \"We'll close your POA&M\" or \"FedRAMP covers everything,\" and the penalties they can trigger.\n- **Non-delegable high-risk functions:** Incident response, privileged access, and continuous monitoring—areas where accountability can never be outsourced.\n- **Lessons from 2025 audits:** Real-world cases where blind trust in ESPs delayed certification—and the corrective actions that brought projects back on track.\n\nYou'll leave with a concise checklist for vetting ESPs, verifying CRMs, and keeping provider support aligned with your obligations—so your organization stays compliant, contract-ready, and firmly in control.\n\nRead More →\n\n![Michael Greenman](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/M.-Greeman-hs.png)\n\n![Andy Sauer](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/A.-Sauer.png)\n\nESP \\| MSP \\| CSP - The Definitive Session: Regs, Offerings, Pricing and Profitability\n\nMichael Greenman\n\nSr. Manager, Cloud Solutions • Deltek\n\nAndy Sauer\n\nCEO • Sentinel Blue\n\n📍 Potomac D\n\nTitle 48, DFARS 7020/7021, and the coming FAR CUI rule have thrust service providers onto the front line of CMMC compliance.

Service providers need to think beyond CMMC to avoid a never-ending game of \"GRC Whack-A-Mole\" that reactively chases client compliance requirements. With the Golden Dome for America (GDA), GSA OASIS+, EO 14028-based Secure Software Development Attestation Form (SSDAFs) and C-SCRM, CMMC requirements are eclipsed by other US and EU-centric requirements that expand far beyond CUI protections.\n\nWhile many requirements can be addressed by NIST SP 800-53 alignment, others exceed the capability that even the US Governments \"gold standard\" framework can support (e.g., AI, privacy, OT, cloud, etc.). This is where service providers need to seriously consider adding a capability to normalize controls through a metaframework. The Secure Controls Framework (SCF) is such a metaframework that creates opportunities to efficiently scale client security and compliance capabilities. Working with the Cyber AB, the SCF's Conformity Assessment Program (SCF CAP) enables clients to demonstrate conformity with common requirements where existing certifications do not exist.\n\nRead More →\n\n12:10 PM - 1:10 PM\n\n🍴\n\n\nLunch\n\n📍 Potomac A/B (Expo Hall)\n\n1:10 PM - 2:40 PM\n\n![Fernando Machado](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/F.-Machado.png)\n\n![Rachel Bassford](https://cs5east.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/R.-Brassford.png)\n\nMock Assessment - Assessor's Point of View\n\nFernando Machado\n\nManaging Principal/CISO • Cybersec Investments\n\nRachel Bassford\n\nCUI Consultant • DEFCERT\n\n📍 Potomac C/D\n\nJoin Fernando Machado of Cybersec Investments!\n\n1. **10 mins Bonus** \\- NIST 88 Rev. 2 Guidelines for Media Sanitization (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r2.pdf)\n2. **50 mins CAP**\\- CMMC Assessment Process\n\n   - Phase One - Scoping Interview\n   - Phase Two - Assessment\n   - Phase Three - Outbrief\n   - Phase Four - Issue Certificate and Close Out POA&M\n3. **Story of Failed Control**\n4. **Story of Successful Control**\n5. **Re-Evaluating a Security Control** (during the assessment)\n6. **Re-Evaluating a Security Control** (during the 180-day POA&M period)\n7. **30 mins Q&A**\n\nRead More →\n\n⚡ Thursday 1:20 - 4:30 PM • Limited to 189 Attendees\n\n## Roundtable Revolution\n\nPractitioner-led sessions where you trade real-world tactics and solutions\n\n\n### How Roundtables Work\n\nEach roundtable seats 10 participants and runs for three consecutive 50-minute sessions.\nFacilitators stay at their tables while groups rotate, allowing you to dive deep into multiple\ntopics throughout the day.

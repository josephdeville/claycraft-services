To that, we say: Yes, it’s the Modash way! Instead of focusing on _your_ niche, put more focus on the influencer _audience_.\n\nHow do you get your data? How accurate is it?\n\nJust like Google, Modash analyzes hundreds of billions of publicly available content and builds insights based on it.\n\nOur data is as accurate as it gets. After auditing our data, some of the fastest-growing B2C companies in the world chose Modash over alternatives. Our data even powers other platforms and internal tools via our [API](https://modash.io/influencer-marketing-api). We update it several times a month, so you can trust you’re getting the most recent info, too.\n\nDo you show analytics & performance metrics for influencers & their followers?\n\nYes. While analytics will vary across platforms we aim to give you a deep understanding of an influencer profile, including their audience.\n\nHere are just some of the metrics available in Modash:\n\n\\- Audience demographics (Age, Gender, Location by city, interests)\n\n\\- Influencer performance (Follower count, Average likes, Engagement rate, Past Paid Post Performance)\n\n\\- Vetting (Popular posts, fake followers)\n\nTo see them all, [try Modash for free.](https://marketer.modash.io/register/marketer)\n\nDo I need to be using Shopify to use Modash?\n\nNo, it's just that ecommerce brands using Shopify get the _most_ value out of Modash. Through our [Shopify integration](https://www.modash.io/shopify), those users get access to extra features. Like sending free products to influencers, running an affiliate program (including payouts), and managing Shopify promo codes.\n\nThe rest of our features work outside of Shopify. Finding influencers, analyzing profiles, managing influencer lists, collecting influencer content, and more. There are hundreds of other types of business using Modash including Airbnb, NordVPN, and Ground News.\n\nCan I track my campaigns with Modash?\n\nModash will collect and track ALL of your branded content (even stories) and store it. No creator signup is required. You’ll also get insights like who posted what type of content and who complied with ad disclosures, as well as the number of discount code redemptions, link clicks, and more.
